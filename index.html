    <h1>Subject: Improving Apprentice Retention at the SENA Center for Industrial Automation</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Dear Dickson,<br><br><br>

        I hope this message finds you well. I am pleased to share details about an innovative project we are developing
        to address a critical issue at the SENA Center for Industrial Automation: apprentice 
        Problem<br><br><br><br>

        The absence of an adequate tool for attendance analysis not only hinders the early identification of apprentices
        at risk of dropping out but also limits the ability of instructors and coordinators to provide personalized and
        timely support to these apprentices.<br><br><br><br>

        Solution<br><br><br>

        - Requirements Analysis: Understanding the specific needs of the center.<br>
        - Data Collection and Processing: Managing the attendance data of apprentices.<br>
        - Report Systematization: Generating reports on the causes of dropout.<br>
        - Data Model Construction: Developing a robust data model.<br>

        Impacts<br><br><br>

        - Collect accurate and timely statistics on dropout alerts.<br>
        - Facilitate specific and effective interventions.<br>
        - Optimize the use of resources.<br>
        - Strengthen the educational community.<br>
        - Improve the apprentice's experience at the center.<br>

        Thank you in advance for your attention, and I am available to discuss more details about this project.<br>

        Sincerely,<br><br><br>
